<h1>debounce</h1>
Anytime you do something on scroll, you will likely want to debounce

<h1>window.scrollY/X</h1>
You can use to see where the user is scrolled to on the page (at the very top of your window).

If you want to see the pixel level of where you currently are at the bottom, then `window.scrollY + window.innerHeight`
