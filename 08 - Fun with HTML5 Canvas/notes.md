<h1>canvas</h1>
Canvas on the web just gives you a block of pixels.
You don't draw directly on the canvas element in html, but you draw on the context.

<h1>ES6 set 2 variables in one line</h1>

    lastX = e.offsetX;
    lastY = e.offsetY;
    // is the same as
    [lastX, lastY] = [e.offsetX, e.offsetY];
