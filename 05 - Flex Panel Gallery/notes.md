<h1>Flexbox</h1>
An element in CSS can be both a flex item as well as a flex container.

Resource: flexbox.io

<h1>Toggling CSS</h1>
`this.classList.toggle('open');`

Instead of 'setProperty' that needs to correspond with a value

<h1>Other notes</h1>
`if (e.propertyName.includes('flex'))` instead of `if (e.propertyName === 'flex')`

Because Safari calls it flex-grow and all other browsers call it flex.
