<h1>Number.toFixed()</h1>

You can use {variableName}.toFixed({amountOfDecimals}) to round numbers to a more friendly display.

<h1>mousemove</h1>

You can put the logic in mousemove to make it seem smooth (rather than mouseup), although then you are manipulating the DOM at a much faster rate.

<h1>mouseclick</h1>

Only fires on mouse up, so if you want to click and drag listen for `mousedown`.
