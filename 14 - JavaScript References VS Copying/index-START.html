    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // these should not change
    let age = 100, age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    let name = 'check';
    let name2 = 'mate';
    console.log(name, name2); // check mate
    name = 'stale';
    console.log(name, name2); // stale mate

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players); // players is updated as well
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way: slice, if you pass nothing, then it creates a copy
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'sliced';
    console.log(team2, players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newTeam = [].concat(players);
    newTeam[3] = 'concat';
    console.log(newTeam, players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const spreadTeam = [...players];
    spreadTeam[0] = 'spread';
    console.log(spreadTeam, players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[0] = 'array from';
    console.log(team5, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100, age: 12})
    console.log(cap2, person);
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.age = 1000000;
    console.log(cap3, person);   
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: '@wesbos',
          facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
      };
      
      console.log(wes);

      const dev = {...wes};
      dev.social.twitter = '@coolio';
      console.log(dev, wes);

      // poor man's deep clone (not performant)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
